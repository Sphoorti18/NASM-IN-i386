###MULTI-TASKING
Prority of tasks is ranged from urgent to mundane tasks!
Running the current tasks + next task is put on hold (waiting mode).

#Characters ==> Task ==> a) State Segment == Current Task is being saved! Divided in 2 sections
                                          == I) Dynamic = Updates are constantly being made to inform the processor about the changes. 
                                                These store : General purpose registers (32 bit), Segment registers (CS, DS, SS, ES, FS, 
                                                OS), EFLAGS and EIP (Instruction pointer).
                                          == II) Static = It's read only field for the processor.
                                                
                                                      
                         a.1) Descriptor
                         a.2) Gate Descriptor
                     ==> b) Switching = 
                     ==> c) Linking 
                     ==> d) Address space
