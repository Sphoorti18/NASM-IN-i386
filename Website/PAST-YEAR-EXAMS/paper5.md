| 202401  | 1           | Multi-tasking      | Explain the concept of multi-tasking in the i386 architecture.           | Multi-tasking in the i386 architecture allows multiple processes to share the CPU concurrently. The i386 supports hardware task switching using the Task State Segment (TSS), which stores the state of a task. The CPU switches tasks by loading the state from the TSS, enabling efficient context switching between tasks. |
| 202401  | 2           | Multi-tasking      | What is the Task State Segment (TSS) in the i386 architecture?           | The Task State Segment (TSS) is a special data structure in the i386 architecture that holds information about a task, including its register state, stack pointers, and segment selectors. The TSS enables hardware-based task switching, allowing the CPU to save the state of the current task and load the state of the next task efficiently. |
| 202401  | 3           | Multi-tasking      | How does hardware task switching work in the i386?                       | Hardware task switching in the i386 involves using the Task State Segment (TSS). When a task switch occurs, the CPU saves the current task's state in its TSS and loads the new task's state from its TSS. This process updates the CPU's registers, stack pointers, and segment selectors, effectively switching contexts between tasks. |
| 202401  | 4           | Protection Mechanism | Describe the protection mechanisms in the i386 architecture.              | The i386 architecture includes several protection mechanisms: segment-level protection using segment descriptors and privilege levels, page-level protection through paging, and the use of the Control Register 0 (CR0) to enable/disable protection features. These mechanisms prevent unauthorized access to memory and ensure system stability. |
| 202401  | 5           | Protection Mechanism | What are segment descriptors in the i386 architecture?                    | Segment descriptors in the i386 architecture are data structures that define the properties of a memory segment, including its base address, limit, type, and privilege level. They are stored in the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) and the Local Descriptor Table (LDT). |
| 202401  | 6           | Protection Mechanism | How does paging contribute to memory protection in the i386?              | Paging in the i386 provides memory protection by dividing the virtual address space into pages and mapping them to physical memory. Each page has associated access rights, and the Memory Management Unit (MMU) checks these rights on each memory access, preventing unauthorized access. |
| 202401  | 7           | Protection Mechanism | What role does the Control Register 0 (CR0) play in the i386 protection mechanism? | The Control Register 0 (CR0) in the i386 architecture is used to control various aspects of the CPU's operation, including enabling or disabling paging and protection mechanisms. Setting specific bits in CR0 activates these features, ensuring that the system enforces memory protection and segmentation rules. |
