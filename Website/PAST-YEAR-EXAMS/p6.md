| Q1     | What is the role of Task Gate Descriptors in context switching in an x86 architecture?             | Task Gate Descriptors are used to define entry points for task switching. They hold a segment selector and an offset to the Task State Segment (TSS).         |
| Q2     | What are the different types of segment descriptors in the Global Descriptor Table (GDT)?          | Types include Code Segment, Data Segment, Task State Segment (TSS), Call Gate, Interrupt Gate, and Trap Gate Descriptors.                                    |
| Q3     | How does the Descriptor Privilege Level (DPL) influence access to a segment?                        | DPL defines the privilege level required to access the segment. A lower DPL means higher privilege, restricting access from less privileged code.             |
| Q4     | What is the significance of the Present (P) bit in a segment descriptor?                            | The Present bit indicates whether the segment is loaded in memory. If set to 0, accessing the segment results in a segment-not-present exception.             |
| Q5     | How do Task State Segment (TSS) descriptors facilitate multitasking?                                | TSS descriptors hold the state of a task, allowing the CPU to save the state of the current task and load the state of the next task during a context switch. |
| Q6     | What information is stored in a Segment Descriptor?                                                | Segment Descriptors store Base Address, Limit, Type, Descriptor Privilege Level (DPL), Segment Present (P), and Granularity (G) bit.                          |
| Q7     | How is a Call Gate Descriptor different from a Task Gate Descriptor?                                | A Call Gate Descriptor is used to switch control to a procedure in a different privilege level, while a Task Gate Descriptor is used for task switching.      |
| Q8     | How does the Granularity (G) bit affect the Limit field in a segment descriptor?                    | The Granularity bit determines if the Limit field is scaled by 1 byte (G=0) or by 4KB (G=1), affecting the size of the addressable segment.                   |
| Q9     | What are the differences between the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) and the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)? | GDT is used for defining memory segments, while IDT is used for defining interrupt and exception handlers.                                                    |
| Q10    | Explain the process of loading the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) register (GDTR).                   | Loading the GDTR involves using the LGDT instruction with a memory operand that specifies the base and limit of the GDT.                                      |
