     - 64 TB virtual memory addressing
     - Paging and segmentation support
     - Enhanced instruction set for multitasking and protection.
   - **b)** Physical address formation in Protected Virtual Address Mode (PVAM) involves:
     - Combining segment base address from a segment descriptor with an offset.
     - Applying the paging mechanism if enabled to convert linear addresses to physical addresses.
   - **c)** Segment descriptor format includes:
     - Base address (20 bits)
     - Limit (20 bits)
     - Type and attributes (12 bits)
   - **d)** Direction flag (DF) is used to determine the direction of string operations (increment or decrement).

2. **Q2.**
   - **a)** Flag register of 80386 microprocessor includes:
     - Status flags: ZF (Zero Flag), SF (Sign Flag), CF (Carry Flag), OF (Overflow Flag), etc.
     - Control flags: IF (Interrupt Flag), DF (Direction Flag), TF (Trap Flag)
   - **b)** Difference between Macro and Procedure:
     - Macros are expanded inline at compile-time, reducing function call overhead but increasing code size.
     - Procedures are called during execution, saving memory but adding call overhead.
   - **c)** Task State Segment (TSS) includes:
     - Processor state information such as registers, stack pointers, and segment selectors.
     - Used for task switching in multitasking environments.
   - **d)** Paging mechanism in 80386 with diagram:
     - Involves page directory and page tables to map linear addresses to physical addresses.
     - Each entry in the page directory/table includes base address and attributes like present, read/write, and user/supervisor.

### Part B

1. **Q3.**
   - **a)** Assembly Language Program (ALP) to find positive & negative numbers from an array:
     ```assembly
     MOV CX, ArraySize
     MOV SI, 0
     MOV DI, 0
     MOV BX, 0 ; Counter for positive numbers
     MOV DX, 0 ; Counter for negative numbers
     NextElement:
       MOV AL, [SI]
       INC SI
       CMP AL, 0
       JL IsNegative
       INC BX ; Increment positive number counter
       JMP Continue
     IsNegative:
       INC DX ; Increment negative number counter
     Continue:
       LOOP NextElement
     ```
   - **b)** Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB):
     - A cache used to reduce the time taken to translate virtual addresses to physical addresses.
     - Stores recent translations of page table entries.
   - **c)** Result in AL after executing `SHL AL,8`:
     - The content of AL will be shifted left by 8 bits, essentially clearing AL to 0.
   - **d)** Protection mechanism at segmentation and paging levels:
     - Segmentation: Ensures each segment has its own access rights and limits.
     - Paging: Each page can have different attributes (e.g., read/write, user/supervisor) providing fine-grained protection.

2. **Q4.**
   - **a)** Interfacing signals of 80386DX with 80387 NDP:
     - BUSY#, ERROR#, and REQUEST# signals manage the coprocessor operations.
   - **b)** Instructions for stack operations and FSAVE:
     - `ADD [SP], R3` - Adds the contents of register 3 to the top of the stack.
     - `SUB [SP], R2` - Subtracts the contents of register 2 from the top of the stack and stores the result in register 2.
     - `FSAVE` saves the state of the floating-point unit to a specified memory location.
   - **c)** Switching from real mode to protected mode:
     - Load the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) with segment descriptors.
     - Set the PE (Protection Enable) bit in CR0 to enable protected mode.

3. **Q5.**
   - **a)** 80387 instructions:
     - `FINIT`: Initializes the floating-point unit.
     - `F2XM1`: Computes 2^X - 1.
     - `FSQRT`: Computes the square root of the operand.
   - **b)** Differences between logical, linear, and physical addresses:
     - Logical addresses: Generated by the CPU during program execution, consisting of a segment selector and an offset.
     - Linear addresses: Produced by adding the segment base address to the offset.
     - Physical addresses: Final addresses after translating linear addresses via the paging mechanism.
   - **c)** FTST vs FXAM:
     - `FTST` tests the floating-point value against 0 and sets the condition flags.
     - `FXAM` examines the floating-point value and classifies it (e.g., zero, normal, infinity).

### Part C

1. **Q6.**
   - **a)** Serial communication modes in 8051:
     - Mode 0: Shift register mode (8-bit shift register)
     - Mode 1: 8-bit UART with variable baud rate.
   - **b)** CPL, DPL, and RPL:
     - CPL: Current Privilege Level, indicates the privilege level of the currently executing task.
     - DPL: Descriptor Privilege Level, specifies the privilege level of a segment descriptor.
     - RPL: Requestor Privilege Level, part of the segment selector, specifies the privilege level of the request.
   - **c)** Timer modes in 8051:
     - Mode 0: 13-bit timer mode.
     - Mode 1: 16-bit timer mode.

2. **Q7.**
   - **a)** Data types supported by 80387:
     - Integer, floating-point, BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal).
   - **b)** Differences between microprocessors and microcontrollers:
     - Microprocessors: General-purpose processors used in computers for diverse applications.
     - Microcontrollers: Integrated systems with a CPU, memory, and peripherals designed for specific control applications.
   - **c)** Timer mode 0 and mode 1 in 8051:
     - Mode 0: 13-bit timer/counter.
     - Mode 1: 16-bit timer/counter.
